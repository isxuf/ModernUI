    "Description": "I have just started using the Modern UI framework and I am using ModernWindow and ModernDialog, as well as ModernButton.\n\nMy problem is after building the application, it runs fine on my machine and all other machines with Visual Studio installed. However, when I try to deploy for business guys, the application does not run. It gives error. \n\nNaturally, I thought .Net framework 4.5 might not be installed on those machines. So I went ahead and did the install. After the install, restarted the application, I still get the same problem. below is the problem signature as displayed by Windows.\n\nProblem signature:\n  Problem Event Name:                        CLR20r3\n  Problem Signature 01:                       ReportManager.exe\n  Problem Signature 02:                       1.0.0.0\n  Problem Signature 03:                       53bda48c\n  Problem Signature 04:                       System.Data\n  Problem Signature 05:                       4.0.30319.34209\n  Problem Signature 06:                       53489aad\n  Problem Signature 07:                       25bd\n  Problem Signature 08:                       27\n  Problem Signature 09:                       System.Data.SqlClient.Sql\n  OS Version:                                          6.1.7601.2.1.0.256.48\n  Locale ID:                                             1033\n  Additional Information 1:                  0a9e\n  Additional Information 2:                  0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789\n  Additional Information 3:                  0a9e\n  Additional Information 4:                  0a9e372d3b4ad19135b953a78882e789\n\nPlease help me. \n\nThanks.",
