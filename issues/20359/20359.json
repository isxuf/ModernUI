    "Description": "Hie... I appologise before hand if this is a stupid question. Its just that I understand that passing values in WPF causes problems if you try the same methods used in winforms. True enough i had a couple of exceptions thrown when I tried it so i was wondering. is there a way to pass a textbox value from the main form to another textbox in a page in this?\n\nI am very new to this. an example is all I need to go by and i'll be fine. Please help.",
