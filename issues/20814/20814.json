    "Description": "Just found out if you don't close a url string and end your bbcode text the app hangs just spinning the CPU.\n\nI had mistakenly not closed the last url tag (TrainInstructions.xaml) like this:\n\n```\n<mui:BBCodeBlock Margin=\"5\" BBCode=\"Once all data sets are created (or loaded from disk), use the [url=/Pages/Train.xaml]Train Tab[/url] to start training. Details on training and performance can be found [url=/Pages/TrainInstructions.xaml\"></mui:BBCodeBlock>\n```\n\nProb not high priority but thought I'd mention it.",
