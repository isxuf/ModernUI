    "Description": "Hi,\n\nI'm using the modern tab control (under .net 4) to navigate between different user controls, I depend on Loaded/Unloaded events for presenting different views,  I noticed the __Loaded__  event is fired again when navigating away to a different user control and the __Unloaded__ event is fired twice. \n\n\nIs this the intended behavior, and why does it reload the control when navigating away ?\n\nMany thanks.",
