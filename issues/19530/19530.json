    "Description": "Run an event when a mui:Link in a ModernTab is clicked (not load a new page). \nIn some cases it is useful not to show another page, but run some action, possibly without page change.\nIt is useful if the links sometimes behave as traditional menu items.",

Please fix this, it's the most voted issue!\n\n\nBTW, it would be nice to add a Command property as well, for MVVM scenarios. However it would require to make Link inherit from DependencyObject to allow binding... changing that would probably have a rather large impact on the overall design of the library.",
