    "Description": "Hi, \r\n\r\nApologies for my ineptitude, but I am unable to resolve the a similar to that posted by BlazingArdor on 28th December.\r\n\r\nHaving installed the extension I create Modern UI WPF Application, it builds but when I go to the mainwindow.xaml the line __Style=\"{StaticResource BlankWindow}\"__ has en error with the 'Object reference not set to an instance of an object' description.  I have tried a number of things to resolve (re-installing etc) but cannot resolve this issue.\r\n\r\nSimilar to this, when viewing the samples, they build but changing any other the styling options causes errors. \r\n\r\nAny help appreciated.\r\n\r\nThanks\r\n\r\nJack\r\n",
