    "Description": "It would be very helpful to add a __SearchTextBox__ to this framework, similar to your __XamlSpy__. This is going to be a great addition to what is already a very great contribution. Especially if people don;t want to mess around other controls from 3rd party vendors, and like to stay with the awesome theme-ing mechanism included with this product.\n\nKudos and more power to this contribution. And of course, a big thank you to the author and all those who contributed in bringing such a wonderful work of art.",
