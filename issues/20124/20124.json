    "Description": "First of all thank you for creating Modern UI, we're going to release our software using it and looks great.\n\nI have a tiny suggestion regarding the border of the standard buttons that I consider would make a difference. Right now a standard button has the same border color as a disabled button. When you have 2 or more such buttons next to each other is a bit difficult to distinguish which one is disabled and which isn't, thus my suggestion is to darken the border of the standard button a bit so that it differentiates from the disabled one - just like I did in the image below:\n\n![Image](http://i.imgur.com/9iXv49q.png)",
