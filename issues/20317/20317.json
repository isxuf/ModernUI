    "Description": "Hi kozw,\n\nI think I found a new issue with the 'System Windows Shell' code that you are using to maximize a window when the taskbar is on Autohide using 2 screens as reported here:\n\nhttp://social.msdn.microsoft.com/Forums/vstudio/en-US/c441624f-8502-4b9c-a970-18b044f6ede5/microsoft-windows-system-shell-has-a-problem-with-maximizing-windows-and-autohidding-taskbar?forum=wpf\n\nThis is just a small request to confirm whether you would agree with my analysis of the problem or not. I would continue to enter a report at the references connect site if yes... thanks for this great work :-)",
