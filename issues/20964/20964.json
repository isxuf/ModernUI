    "Description": "Hi, I was browsing the internets for a week, but I still have no idea how to do this.\nImagine that:\nI have a datagrid to show some data entries, and I also want to make an edit page for this entries.\nHow can I do this?\n```\n    public partial class Edit : UserControl\n    {\n        Entities db;\n\n        public Edit(int entityid)\n        {\n            InitializeComponent();\n            // Grab data by id and display it\n\n        }\n }\n\n```\nI hope this is possible.\nThanks",
