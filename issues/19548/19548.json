This requirement is key when you have a number of apps constructed based on this framework, and that are used regularily. \r\n\r\nMy users can't readily distinguish between the various (LOB) applications that I have constructed on this framework. Of course they can goto the \"Welcome\" page of each app and see the application's title there, but a quick identifier (i.e: application's title) needs to be part of the user interface ASAP.\r\n\r\nTo make it simple, the title can simply a disabled title link docked to the left of the main window which would make it be at the same height as the other title links, but have some visual distintion between them.\r\n\r\n__Awesome__ framework and my users are super satisified, but they __need__ to be able to __quickly identify__ what application they are in.\r\n\r\n",
