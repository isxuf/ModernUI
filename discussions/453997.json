I have seen examples how to do this in code, such as:<br />\n<pre><code>If Windows.Application.Current Is Nothing Then\n    Dim app As New Windows.Application\n    app.Resources(&quot;AccentColor&quot;) = System.Windows.Media.Colors.Green\nEnd If\n\nnewGUI = New NewGUI.ConfigWindow\nnewGUI.Show()</code></pre>\n\nUnfortunately, I cannot get this to work, and nothing happens.<br />\n<br />\nI was also wondering if there was a way to set the AccentColor property directly in XAML, or through a custom MUI Window property, instead of from code directly. I may want several windows different colors.<br />\n<br />\nIf not possible, could someone provide me a way to do this in code properly?<br />\n<br />\nThanks,<br />\n<ul>\n<li>\nJake M.<br />\n</li>\n</ul>\nEdit:<br />\n<br />\nThis is a project calling and creating a window from a separate project, if this is an issue.<br />\n",
