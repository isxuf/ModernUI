However, I've come across a small problem for which I can not figure out a workaround.<br />\n<br />\nI'd like to do the following:<br />\n<br />\nFetch workout exercises from a database and add their names to ModernTab.Links. Each exercise consists of similar attributes which I'd like to display in identical form, but with different values. That said, I believe I'd like to add Links to moderntab programmatically, where the source xaml is identical.<br />\n<br />\nI realize I could do this by creating a listbox, but then I would lose the swiping effect of a ListPage.<br />\n<br />\nAs I believe this should be possible, I ask: has anyone done anything related to this? I'd be glad if someone could help me out here. If you need me to elaborate on the issue, please let me know. <br />\n<br />\nBest regards,<br />\n<br />\nJonne<br />\n",
