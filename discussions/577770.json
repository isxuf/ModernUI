I added Style.xaml to my Resources and added image to Main Menu Grid:\r<br />\n<br />\n&lt;Image Grid.Column=&quot;2&quot; Source=&quot;/Path/To/Image/File.png&quot; /&gt;\r<br />\n<br />\nThis adds a static image to the desired location on top. I need to change this so that the image source changes dynamically by taking the URI from current opened XAML file.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks.<br />\n",
