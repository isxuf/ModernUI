Now with modern UI template in VS2012, in the solution project created there is no code or sample showing how to implement dialog support.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo how would you implement dialog support using your preferred mvvm framework. A example would be appreciated.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards<br />\n",
