I want to do it in a good looking manner and modern UI seems like the perfect tool however I do not know how to get started. I went through the tutorial but how do I keep going forware i.e. adding a button? I got one added but can't get it to go to the place where I want. I also wanted to know if it would be possible to connect this to a database such as mysql? Thanks for the help!<br />\n",
