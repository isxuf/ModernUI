So, I wanna to know, whether you have the plan to add statusbar from the source on the following versions? Or if I want to modify from source, any guide advice?<br />\n<br />\nPS: Like this: <a href=\"http://www.devcomponents.com/kb2/?p=1197\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://www.devcomponents.com/kb2/?p=1197</a><br />\n<br />\nAnother thing, I realized to save the settings for themes. I think this function might need to be added to &quot;Modern UI for WPF Templates&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nThank you guys very much for realizing such a good UI!<br />\n<br />\nBest Regards,<br />\nClaude<br />\n",
