I really enjoy your Project.<br />\nBut i have one Question. ;)<br />\n<br />\nIs't possible to reference the Source from a LinkGroup to Page from a external DLL, loaded with MEF? <br />\n<br />\n<strong>MainWindow.xaml</strong><br />\n<pre><code>   &lt;mui:LinkGroup DisplayName=&quot;external&quot;&gt;\n        &lt;mui:LinkGroup.Links&gt;\n            &lt;mui:Link DisplayName=&quot;transfer&quot; Source=&quot;/transfer.xaml&quot; /&gt;\n            &lt;!-- Source should be loaded Page from Assembly --&gt;\n        &lt;/mui:LinkGroup.Links&gt;\n    &lt;/mui:LinkGroup&gt;</code></pre>\n\nI think of an idea to load all additional Pages from DLLs, at the beginning of initialization of the Client, like block moduls.<br />\n<br />\nThanks in Advance<br />\n",
