Thanks for it.\r<br />\n<br />\nI would like to know if I can re create my ex WPF business app using this tool.\r<br />\n<br />\nAfter looking in to your sample app, I recognized that the pages I want to load into the stage (or main window or ...) must be linked via <strong>&lt;mui:Link</strong>.\r<br />\n<br />\nBut in a business app it is not good to include more pages (may be 100s) like this. Can I create a toolbar (something like the ribbon in my previous app) add include buttons for loading pages?<br />\n",
