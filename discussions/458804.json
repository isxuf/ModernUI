However I do not see any ModernUI feature for parsing the querystring values.  The NavigationEventArgs provided to that method to not contain a collection of query string values or anything helpful like that.  Am I left to my own devices as to parsing that Query string?\r<br />\n<br />\nWhy not just formalize on using Querystring type formatting. a known format to most developers, for supplying values on the Uri and providing these values to the OnFragmentNavigation method instead.<br />\n",
