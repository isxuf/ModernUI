Amazing job and thanks to all who have contributed!\r<br />\n<br />\nAnyway, I'm looking for whether the ModernTab control has any form of notifying on click- I need to create a set of tabs programmatically for editing employees in my database, and rather than go with a list box or anything I'd like to use a list of tabs and just have a tab for each user created at runtime. \r<br />\n<br />\nIf anyone knows of a way that I can do this, I'd sure appreciate it!<br />\n",
