Say for example when the application is started there will only be one link visible named Connection. In the connection view the user can enter a connection string and press a button ok. Now the next view will be shown, ie the navigation is done from the first view not by clicking a link but by clicking the ok button. But how can I make the link appear only when the view is shown?<br />\n",
