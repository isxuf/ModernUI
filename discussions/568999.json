The &quot;SomeCommand&quot; is never executed.\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso tried to place the code on Window level as I assume it has something to do with focus, but I haven't been able to do it. It might be kind of an easy question so hopefully somebody are able to answer me quickly/shortly.\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance<br />\n",
