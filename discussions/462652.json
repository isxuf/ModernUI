I've found that WPF can't do that without referencing some Windows Forms APIs (<a href=\"http://ebbypeter.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/minimize-a-wpf-application-to-system-tray-in-c/\" rel=\"nofollow\">http://ebbypeter.wordpress.com/2010/06/28/minimize-a-wpf-application-to-system-tray-in-c/</a>), but I can't get it to work. I tried implementing it, but it seems like the constructor for MainWindow never gets hit.\r<br />\n<br />\nDo you have any guidance on how to make this work?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
