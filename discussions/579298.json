See below my XAML instruction with Command and CommandParameter attributes for your reference.\r<br />\n<br />\n&lt;mui:Link DisplayName=&quot;Languages&quot; Source=&quot;/Views/LanguagesList.xaml&quot; Command=&quot;{Binding NavigateCommand}&quot; CommandParameter=&quot;AppSettings&quot; / &gt;\r<br />\n<br />\nIf you can confirm what’s the best method to archive this goal, that will be great!\r<br />\n<br />\nMany Thanks\r<br />\nSandro Peixoto<br />\n",
