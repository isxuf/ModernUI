Then the application creates a Link for each queue and initializes a UserControl which takes the name of the queue as a parameter. All links point to the same xaml file called Queues.xaml. Queues.xaml is bound to a QueuesViewModel which holds a Dictionary&lt;queuename, UserControl&gt; and a property ActiveUserControl. Queues.xaml contains only a ContentPresenter which is bound to the ActiveUserControl property in the ViewModel. <br />\n<br />\nNow, i need to update the ActiveUserControl property every time a link is clicked. <br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance<br />\n",
