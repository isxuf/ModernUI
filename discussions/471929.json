Because I want to implement a localisation into my application. It works fine for the content of pages and usercontrols, but the menu is not updated whatever I try.<br />\nSo far I derived &quot;Displayable&quot; from DependendyObject but now I am struggling with the question, how to update the &quot;MenuLinkGroupProperty&quot; in &quot;ModernMenu&quot;. Or maybe in &quot;ModernWindow&quot;? <br />\nI would really appreciate every single one of your ideas. <br />\nI am still new to C#, WPF and ModernUI and my english may not be perfect so please be patient ;-) <br />\n<br />\nGreetings, <br />\nBoi<br />\n",
