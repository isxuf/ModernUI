Is there an easy way to do this?\r<br />\n<br />\nOn a related note... is there a way to save the color choice, theme, and font size within the app so that the theme states stick on re-launch?  It currently rolls back to the default when the app is closed and reopened.\r<br />\n<br />\nThank you in advance.<br />\n",
