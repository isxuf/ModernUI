But this prevents me from entering text in a text box on that page.<br />\n<pre><code>private void ModernWindow_PreviewKeyDown(object sender, KeyEventArgs e)\n{\n            if (ModernMenu.SelectedPage == @&quot;/Pages/Controls.xaml&quot;)\n            {\n\n                e.Handled = true;\n\n                if (OnMainKeyPress != null)\n                    OnMainKeyPress(this, e);\n            }\n}</code></pre>\n\nIf possible, I would like to prevent the left and right keys from selecting the links in the menu. Does anyone know how to do this?<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",
