To overcome the problem, I have two options: 1. To add navigation to Page1.xaml (may be impossible) or 2. find a way to navigate to MainWindow (and this should be easy, I can't find a reasonable reason why this appears to need a miracle to be done! this is a basic need)\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm using this code for naviagtion:<br />\n<pre><code>string url = &quot;/MainWindow.xaml&quot;;\nBBCodeBlock bbBlock = new BBCodeBlock();\nbbBlock.LinkNavigator.Navigate(new Uri(url, UriKind.Relative), this, FirstFloor.ModernUI.Windows.Navigation.NavigationHelper.FrameSelf);</code></pre>\n\nwhen running this code, it navigates when url is a window name dervied from UserControl, but when running the above code, I encounter this exception:<br />\n<pre><code>&quot;Unable to navigate to /MainWindow.xaml, could not find a ModernFrame target '_self'&quot;</code></pre>\n\nHow could I resolve this?<br />\n",
