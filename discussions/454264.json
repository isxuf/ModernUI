The closest I came to was SubMenuText, which changes the color of the mui:Link. I need something to change mui:LinkGroup. I figured MenuText would work, but it did not. I exhausted all other &quot;likely&quot; properties too. Does anyone know the correct property for this?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks in advance,<br />\n<ul>\n<li>Jake M. </li>\n</ul>\n",
