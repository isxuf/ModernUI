    "Html": "As I can see, mui(Modern UI) uses a static Resource in Project Property Page. So the problem is raised when I use ModernDialog.ShowDialog() Function in a nonenglish UI Environment, for example Japanese and also Chinese.<br />\nBy reading the source code, I found that ModernDialog Buttons' creation routine uses hard-coding string resource. As following:<br />\n<pre><code>    /// &lt;summary&gt;\n    /// Gets the Ok button.\n    /// &lt;/summary&gt;\n    public Button OkButton\n    {\n        get\n        {\n            if (this.okButton == null) {\n                this.okButton = CreateDialogButton(FirstFloor.ModernUI.Resources.Ok, true, false, this.closeTrueCommand);\n            }\n            return this.okButton;\n        }\n    }\n</code></pre>\n\nFirstFloor.ModernUI.Resources.Ok equls &quot;OK&quot;. In nonEnglish Environment, We wound not like to see &quot;OK&quot;.<br />\n<br />\nHere is My question: Is there a easily way to do Localization job in Modern UI(imported as DLL)?<br />\n<br />\nps. I would prefer to use Modern UI DLL commonly, so I don't wanna modify the source code and recompile it.<br />\n",

Help!<br />\nI made a txt file named &quot;FirstFloor.ModernUI.Resources.zh-Hans.txt&quot;, which contained(as it was defined in mui projects' Resources.recx):<br />\n<pre><code>Cancel=取消\nClose=关闭\nNavigationFailed=导航失败\nNavigationFailedFrameNotFound=不能导航到 {0}，找不到任何 ModernFrame 目标 '{1}'\nNavigationFailedSourceNotSpecified=不能导航到 {0}，未指定源\nNo=否\nOk=确定\nUIThreadRequired=操作需要UI线程\nUnexpectedToken=意外的令牌\nUnknownTokenType=未知令牌类型\nYes=是</code></pre>\n\nAs you can see, I translated these English into Simplified Chinese ones. The &quot;zh-Hans&quot; stands for Simplified Chinese.<br />\nThen I used &quot;resgen FirstFloor.ModernUI.Resources.zh-Hans.txt&quot; command to compile .txt file into .resources one.<br />\nAfter that, the followint command was executed:<br />\n<pre><code>al /t:lib /embed:FirstFloor.ModernUI.Resources.zh-Hans.resources /culture:zh-Hans /out:FirstFloor.ModernUI.resources.dll /template:FirstFloor.ModernUI.dll</code></pre>\n\nAnd I got FirstFloor.ModernUI.resources.dll.<br />\nFinally, having copied FirstFloor.ModernUI.resources.dll to zh-Hans folder together with .resources file, I ran the demo, ModernDialog's buttons were still in English. <br />\n",
