    "Html": "Hello,\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm trying to create multiple ModernMenu in a ModernWindow. I want to show the first ModernMenu if a binded value is true, otherwise the second ModernMenu with different LinkGroups should be visible. I know that it is possible to do so in the code behind, but I have to manage it in xaml :( To hide one of those ModernMenu, I use the visibility property (visible / collapsed) of the control. Or is there an other way to show different link groups on different conditions?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks a lot!<br />\n",
