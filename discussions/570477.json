I need one however, so now I'm asking for advice about how such a control best could be implemented on top of existing m:ui infrastructure. \r<br />\n<br />\nI'm looking to implement a set of buttons (tiles) on a page automatically displayed at the launch of the application. Each button associated with a view to be displayed when the button is pressed.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'd be very grateful for a push in the right direction! :)\r<br />\n<br />\n// Magnus<br />\n",

I'll use it as it is for my next application... :)\r<br />\nAnother thing came to my mind though - does anyone have any tips for using Blend together with m:ui?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks again in advance!\r<br />\n<br />\n// Magnus<br />\n",
