I am new to C# and WPF and yet I was able to create a beautiful UI.\r<br />\n<br />\nMy problem is how to pass data within your tabs. I have a ListBox on the left of my page and a ModernTab to the right of it. Now I want to pass data out of the selected Item from the listbox to the different tabs. Since those are only links with no further fields I am kind of stuck.\r<br />\n<br />\nI am very aware that this is probably due to my limited experience with c# but it would be very kind if someone could help me anyway.\r<br />\n<br />\nKIind regards,\r<br />\nUrm3l<br />\n",

    "Html": "Good to hear mui is working well for you. Passing data using links is limited but possible by adding a fragment to your Link.Source. You can access the Fragment by implementing the IContent interface and handle the OnFragmentNavigation method.<br />\n<br />\nAssume your link source is /Pages/MyPage.xaml#foo, where foo is the fragment. Then in your MyPage.xaml.cs you need to implement IContent like so:<br />\n<pre><code>public partial class MyPage : UserControl, IContent\n{\n  public void OnFragmentNavigation(FragmentNavigationEventArgs e)\n  {\n    if (e.Fragment == &quot;foo&quot;) {\n      // do something\n    }\n  }\n\n  public void OnNavigatedFrom(NavigationEventArgs e)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public void OnNavigatedTo(NavigationEventArgs e)\n  {\n  }\n\n  public void OnNavigatingFrom(NavigatingCancelEventArgs e)\n  {\n  }\n}</code></pre>\n\nCurrently only string data in the form of uri fragments can be passed around. You can use it as identifier for your actions.<br />\n",
