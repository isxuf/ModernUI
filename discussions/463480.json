I do, however, have a small concern.\r<br />\n<br />\nThe resize grip in the corner of the window is usually used to offer a larger area that the user can click on, in order to resize the window, other than the border window itself.\r<br />\n<br />\nIn m:ui, however, it seems to have a purely aesthetical function, as dragging it does nothing, and I still have to aim for the borders.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this intentional?<br />\n",
