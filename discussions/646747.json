The option to create a resource dictionary file is not in the <strong>Add Item</strong> menu. I verified this by creating a new ModernUI Navigation App and then tried doing an Add Item on the project; adding a resource dictionary isn't there. It's possible to create a resource file, but that is not the same thing.\r<br />\n<br />\nSo why does this template remove the ability to create a resource dictionary file?<br />\n",
