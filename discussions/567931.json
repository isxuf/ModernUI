What I was aiming for was to help him get his code applicable to all of WPF. He's got a good infrastructure going, and I'm good at giving things dependencies so they become dynamic.\r<br />\nSo to reply:<br />\n<ol>\n<li>I'm going to work on that. Tomorrow, probably.</li>\n<li>Am I going to fork it, or become a developer and contribute directly through source control?</li>\n</ol>\n",
