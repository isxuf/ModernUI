But OnNavigatingFrom is not called when I quit the application by closing the main window.\r<br />\n<br />\nI can do it in Windows Unloaded event handler. But I will have to check unsaved changes in 2 places (OnNavigatingFrom and Windows_Unloaded). Is there a better way?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks.<br />\n",
