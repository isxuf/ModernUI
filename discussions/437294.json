Roughly speaking, if switching back and forth between the elements of a surprising number of occupied memory is increasing. and judging by the control logic created and only loaded-unloaded. But, by making use of memory is always surprising number growing? I try to make something like this:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;Grid Style=&quot;{StaticResource ContentRoot}&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;! - TODO: set @ SelectedSource -&gt;\n     &lt;mui:ModernFrame KeepContentAlive=&quot;False&quot;&gt;\n     &lt;mui:ModernTab Layout=&quot;List&quot; SelectedSource=&quot;/View/Test1.xaml&quot;&gt;\n         &lt;mui:ModernTab.Links&gt;\n             &lt;mui:Link DisplayName=&quot;some 1&quot; Source=&quot;/View/Test1.xaml&quot; /&gt;\n             &lt;mui:Link DisplayName=&quot;some 2&quot; Source=&quot;/View/Test2.xaml&quot; /&gt;\n             &lt;mui:Link DisplayName=&quot;some 3&quot; Source=&quot;/View/Test3.xaml&quot; /&gt;\n         &lt;/ mui: ModernTab.Links&gt;\n     &lt;/ mui: ModernTab&gt;\n     &lt;/ mui: ModernFrame&gt;\n&lt;/ Grid&gt;\n</code></pre>\n\nbut nothing has changed.<br />\n<br />\ncan tell me what to do to not waste memory for nothing?<br />\n",
