    "Html": "Hi kozw,\r<br />\n<br />\nI've noticed a consistent CPU usage of between 2 - 7 percent whilst using a Modern UI application (at idle). This usage disappears when the application is hidden. This effect can be seen with your demo application.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs this expected behaviour? It's not causing an issue at present, but previous WPF applications I've written have not exhibited this CPU usage whilst idle.\r<br />\n<br />\nHappy to provide further details if required.\r<br />\n<br />\nAll things considered, this is an excellent piece of work - many thanks.\r<br />\n<br />\nRegards,\r<br />\nMatt<br />\n",

I have been wondering the same thing, on my dev environment application processor usage dropped from 0,9 -&gt; 0 in idle state.<br />\n",
