This is how I am doing it:<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;ImageBrush x:Key=&quot;WindowBackground&quot; ImageSource=&quot;Images/imgConfigWindow.png&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>\n\nHowever it does not work. It <em>does</em> work with properties such as ButtonBackground, InputBackground, etc. Pretty much any property that gets set as a Brush Type.\r<br />\n<br />\nIt just seems like the WindowBackground property isn't working with my image.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm probably misunderstand a concept here, but shouldn't this let me set the window a background of an image?<br />\n",

Not sure if this is a bug or not, ModernWindow uses a coloranimation to switch background colors when changing the theme at runtime.\r<br />\n<br />\nAs a workaround use the <code>WindowBackgroundContent</code> resource like so;<br />\n<pre><code>&lt;Image x:Key=&quot;WindowBackgroundContent&quot; x:Shared=&quot;false&quot; Source=&quot;Images/imgConfigWindow.png&quot; Stretch=&quot;UniformToFill&quot;/&gt;</code></pre>\n\nMake sure <code>x:Shared=&quot;false&quot;</code>, so the rectangle can be re-used among ModernWindow and ModernDialog instances.<br />\n",
