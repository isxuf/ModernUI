For most of what we're doing that's exactly what we want, but there are times where I want to show that header to the user. Since I don't know how ModernUI is hiding/collapsing the TabItem, I don't know how to show it.\r<br />\n<br />\nHow do I show the header of a tabitem, of a tabcontrol under these circumstances?<br />\n",
