I traced it and reached ModernMenu which is a control but again I can not understand how it visualizes itself?\r<br />\n<br />\nAny help and guidance; please?<br />\n",

If this sounds new, you probably want to read up on MVVM. Plenty of articles on the webs about this topic.\r<br />\n<br />\nLink supports textual content only (following Modern UI guidelines), if you need images you need to modify the Link source code and control bindings that render the links.<br />\n",
