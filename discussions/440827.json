    "Html": "Pre-creating pages is not supported, but that is not necessarily a bad thing. My suggestion is to use MVVM where your view and data are loosely coupled. Create your model on startup and start collecting your data. The moment your page is selected and loaded, create your viewmodel and associated it with your instantiated data model. Then use bindings to display your realtime data.<br />\n",
