I have changed it to 140 for my purpose, but one title was long. I liked it to be wrapped.

Consider creating an issue for it in the issuetracker.<br />\n<blockquote>\n2 - modern tab in list mode: title width is fixed (170 if I remember correctly).

For text wrapping you'll need to update the template and set the TextBlock.TextWrapping to Wrap in the template for the list layout.<br />\n<blockquote>\n3 - (not restriction, nor bug but my lack of wpf knowledge == MLOWK) too much white space around tab content in list mode.

Feel free to change the page margins if you feel it's not appropiate in your scenario.<br />\n<blockquote>\n4 - in a modern window with multiple nested link groups: sometimes when I click another main group, it still shows the children of the previous group.

    "Html": "BTW I should explain why I prefer MUI to MashApps.Metro. The main reason is MUI employs a Page based approach to representing the content; instead of having a huge, bulky, single page beautiful app which it's fancy parts just move around the in-memory-loaded content.\r<br />\n<br />\nThis has a huge effect on performance and - believe it or not - there are more low end, old PCs out there than we are aware with Windows XP on them!\r<br />\n<br />\nMashApps.Metro has very nice controls which I hope come to MUI in time, but I think MUI approach is cleaner and lighter.\r<br />\n<br />\n(And BTW I am not a WPF guru - yet! But this things are inferred from actual working with MUI.)<br />\n",
