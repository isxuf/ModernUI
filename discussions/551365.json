Just doing a quick google search on animations showed that one can simply set the Timeline's DesiredFrameRate to a lower framerate (anything 30fps and below) and it will fix the animations CPU usage. I didn't want to do this as animations look bad, so I looked through the code to see what animations are working in the background. It seems like the progressbar's template is using an animation in the background? So I simply removed the RepeatBehavior property from it's StoryBoard. This code can be found in ProgressBar.xaml (line 24) [RepeatBehavior=&quot;Forever&quot;]. \r<br />\nNow the CPU usage is down to 0% on idle. I'm sure there is a better way of doing this instead of just removing the RepeatBehavior. \r<br />\n<br />\nAnyway thanks for the awesome code, I'm using it in my latest project and works great :-)<br />\n",
