And this does not work.<br />\n<br />\nSo in ShellViewModel i have added this:<br />\n<pre><code>        private void NavigateToView(string view)\n        {\n            var frame = (ShellView) ViewLocator.LocateForModelType(typeof(ShellViewModel), null, null);\n            if (frame != null)\n            {\n                frame.ContentSource = new Uri(view, UriKind.Relative);\n            }\n        }</code></pre>\n\nAnd when i run the method:<br />\n<pre><code>NavigateToView(&quot;/Views/Page1.xaml&quot;);</code></pre>\n\ni would expect the ContentLoader to be called and the frame to navigate to the page.  But none of this happens.<br />\nThe constructor for Pag1's view or viewmodel is not called.  The ContentLoader is not called.<br />\n<br />\nAm i suppose to do something after ContentSource is set?  In all the examples, Source is set, but i cannot find this property for the ModernWindow.<br />\n<br />\nI also have not gotten the IContent interface to work.

But i believe i am getting closer.<br />\n<br />\nThe Shell is a ModernWindow.  The Shell's ContentSource is a ModernFrame called mainFrame.  I made mainFrame's ContentLoader be my CaliburnContentLoader.  Then i made mainFrame's Source HomeView which is a UserControl (this is a hack until i figure out how to load mainFrame somewhere properly).  The HomeView is loaded at startup properly.

It does work from a button using xaml.<br />\n<br />\n<br />\nWORKS<br />\n<pre><code>Command=&quot;NavigationCommands.GoToPage&quot; CommandParameter=&quot;/Views/Page1View.xaml&quot;</code></pre>\n\nDOES NOT WORK<br />\n<pre><code>var frame = NavigationHelper.FindFrame(null, Shell);\nframe.Source = new Uri(&quot;/Views/Page1View.xaml&quot;, UriKind.Relative);</code></pre>\n\nNow i thought that because Shell had mainFrame as it's ContentSource i could use Shell to find the frame.<br />\nBut no frame is found.  I found the code for NavigationHelper and it is looking for the Decendents of Shell that are ModernFrames which it finds none.<br />\n<br />\nSo i cheated and put mainFrame in my container so at least i could find it and then set the Source for mainFrame, but the view never navigates.<br />\n<br />\nI followed how NavigationCommands.GoToPage does it of setting the Source to a URI of the page path, so i am not sure why it does not work.<br />\n",
