    "Html": "Hi,\r<br />\n<br />\nI tried to create a custom splash screen that displays the loading process (e.g. plugins, connecting to server etc.). \r<br />\n<br />\nSo, I have WPF window that contains a progress bar and labels, that show those information. I override the OnStartup method in App.xaml.cs like that:<br />\n<pre><code>    protected override void OnStartup(StartupEventArgs e)\n    {\n      var splashScreen = new myNamespace.Forms.SplashScreen();\n      splashScreen.Show();\n\n      var startupTask = new Task(() =&gt;\n      {\n        //Load plugins, connect etc.\n      });\n\n      startupTask.ContinueWith(p =&gt;\n      {\n        MainWindow mainWindow = new MainWindow();\n\n        //when main windows is loaded close splash screen\n        mainWindow.Loaded += (sender, args) =&gt; splashScreen.Close();\n\n        //set application main window;\n        this.MainWindow = mainWindow;\n\n        //and finally show it\n        mainWindow.Show();\n        //});\n      }, TaskScheduler.FromCurrentSynchronizationContext());\n\n      startupTask.Start();\n\n      base.OnStartup(e);\n    }</code></pre>\n\nThe problem is the splashScreen is never closing and applying the ModernUI style.\r<br />\n<br />\nIs it any solution how to show a dynamic splashScreen?<br />\n",
