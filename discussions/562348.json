My new Back Button somehow does not &quot;share the navigation history&quot; (or something like that I think) with the original Back Button even though it is still the same instance of <code>ModernWindow</code>. I think it is probably because the <code>Content</code> is not the same and that's why it doesn't work.\r<br />\nAm I right or is it something else? And is there a way how to fix this problem?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks ;-)<br />\n",
