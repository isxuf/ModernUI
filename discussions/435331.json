I've been working with it for a few days and it's a real pleasure.\r<br />\n<br />\nI'm curious if there is any means to intercept navigation events so as to prevent navigating away from a view.\r<br />\nFor example, if there is a validation error that needs to be resolved prior to leaving the page, or if I wanted to commit some changes when the user navigated away.  Is there anything built into your toolkit to handle that?  Or possibly something already present in WPF?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks!<br />\n",

For example a MuiBootstrapper, since that is the best know route most solutions follow for now, that would allow you for example to inject 1) a custom DI or IOC framework, 2) a navigation service, 3) Animation service,  4)  Menu Service etc.. So as Mr Kozw provides more goodies, we can always swap out UI framework pieces for custom ones, making Mui very flexible.<br />\n",
