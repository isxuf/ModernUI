I am wondering about updating the Accent color while the app is still open \r<br />\n<br />\nBasically I have an app that throws a 1 or 0 into a database identifying that the last function raised an exception. Now I would like to have the accent color change to yellow for instance so identify an error state. I can get it to change on application start up, but i am unable to get it to change whilst the application is still open. <br />\n",
