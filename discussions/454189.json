The workaround is required for a bug in the .NET 4 runtime where resources are not resolved.\r<br />\n<br />\nWhen .NET 4.5 is installed, it replaces the .NET4 runtime and fixes a couple of bugs, including the resolve resource issue. When targetting .NET4 just make sure you have the workaround in place and you're good to go.<br />\n",
