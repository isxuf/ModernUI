Or is there a way to reuse some styles that have already been provided?\r<br />\n<br />\nAlso, I was wondering if there was a simple way to reclaim some of the header space on a modern window? I am talking about the rather large gap between the top of the content and the top of the window.\r<br />\n<br />\nLastly, I believe this might relate to modifying the header space as well, can the position of the title links be altered?\r<br />\n<br />\nThanks,\r<br />\nAlex.<br />\n",
